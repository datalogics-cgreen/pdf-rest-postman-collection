How to get started with the pdfRest Postman Collection:

1. [Download the contents of this repository](https://github.com/datalogics/pdf-rest-postman-collection/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip) and unzip.
2. Import `"pdfRest API.postman_collection.json"` into your Postman Workspace as a collection.
3. To add your API key, go to **Collections** -> **pdfRest API** -> **Authorization**. The authorization **Type** should already be set to *Api Key*, and the **Key** field should read *Api-Key*.
4. In the **Value** field, replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the value of your API key.
5. Choose any request in the pdfRest collection and go to the request's **Body** tab.
6. Next to the `file` key, click **Select Files** to upload an input file for your request.
