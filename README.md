# pdf-rest-postman-collection

How to get started with the pdfRest Postman Collection:

1. [Download the contents of this repository](https://github.com/datalogics/pdf-rest-postman-collection/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip) and unzip.
2. Import `"pdfRest API.postman_collection.json"` into your Postman Workspace as a Collection.
3. The pdfRest API Collection is configured to automatically send an `Api-Key` header with each request. To add your API key, go to **Collections** -> **pdfRest API** -> **Authorization**. The authorization **Type** should already be set to *Api Key*, and the **Key** field should read *Api-Key*. In the **Value** field, replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the value of your API key.
4. Copy the `pdfrest-api-sample-input` folder into your Postman working directory.

You are now ready to begin sending requests!
